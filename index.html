                <h2>Brownie</h2>
                <p>A female golden hamster, Brownie was my very first pet, bought all the way back in 1994 when I lived in St. Louis. I like to think I was a good hamster mom but I <em>WAS</em> eight, and I think I enjoyed playing with the hamster a little more than she enjoyed playing with me!</p>
                <p>Brownie proved to be a little Houdini, escaping a number of times. Fortunately hamsters are predictable enough to be caught afterwards! Assuming she wanted to leave her cage (who wouldn't?) I built a mansion out of lego to act as a 'getaway' for the hamster. I'm not sure she liked being it there more than any other cage, but she sure liked chewing up lego blocks!</p>
                <p>Another memoriable story about Brownie occured when we moved to Austin TX in 1995 with my dad's job. We flew down, and our stuff took a moving truck - but you can't leave a hamster on a truck for a week, nor can you take them on a flight. So, my Dad's boss, who was moving with the company, took Brownie in for a week before carefully loading the cage into his car for the drive down. Now THAT is a good boss!</p>
                <p>Unfotunately, like all hamsters, Brownie didn't live very long. After only two years she died when I was in St Louis for our Christmas 1996 vacation. The night I got the news was one of the worst nights in my young life. Still, she left behind a lot of good memories and experiences that would shape me for years to come.</p>

                    <h2>Brownie Junior</h2>
                    <p>After I lost Brownie I struggled for a while but eventually decided I was ready to share my love with another little hamster. Another female golden hamster, Brownie Junior or BJ inhereted Brownie's lego mansion and talent for escaping from her cage.</p>
                    <p>BJ didn't have quite so many memorable adventures as Brownie, although she did get out once during another Christmas trip - and was free so long the neighbors who were watching her had to buy us a no-kill squirrel trap to eventually catch her since all other attempts at luring her back failed. I still wonder what she got up do during her Grand Escape.</p>
                    <p>BJ also had her own train, in that we had one of those battery powered christmas tree trains from a store, and it was big enough to fit a hamster inside the box car. So, predictably, I put the poor hamster inside the box car and turned on the train. Hamsters don't see all that well and I can't imagine BJ enjoyed being flung around a train track whilst not being able to properly see anything outside. Whoops!</p>
                    <p>After BJ passed on, I decided I was done with pets for a while. As much as I loved having a little buddy to love, saying goodbye was just too hard.</p>

                    <h2>Ash</h2>
                    <p>The year is 2017. I had grown and changed enormously since I had my two childhood hamsters. But once again I was feeling lonely and wanted a furry friend to confide in. I had always wanted a cat, but with my Mom being allergic, it was never something I could adopt until I moved back to St. Louis in 2015 - I was on my own and building a new life. That October my fiance and I went to a bonfire one of our friends held, and got to talking about pets. I just happened to mention that I didn't have a pet but really did want a cat. Another friend piped up "You want a cat huh?"</p>
                    <p>Ash, so far had lived a bit of a hard life. A shy but affectionate little tabby, Ash had been bitten in a fight with another cat as a kitten and had a notch torn in his ear. He had been groomed so roughly by the dog that he developed a bald spot on his back that has never healed. He and his sister Cinder had been adopted twice since then, and they were only 3 years old.</p>
                    <p> Our friend loved Ash and Cinder both, but after the second adpotion Cinder had teamed up with her dog to antagonize Ash, who had taken to spending most of his time hiding under the bed. Nothing she did eased the problem, and soon Ash was being outright attacked by the bigger pets. There simply wasn't enough room in the small apartment for the three pets, and with Ash so miserable, my friend decided he needed a home where he could own his own space. That's where I came in. We talked that night and decided that I would take Ash in a week later - Halloween.</p>
                    <p>I spent the week researching how to care for a cat, cleaning up, and "Catproofing" if such a thing can really be done. Fortunately, our friend had included the basics like a litter box and a bag of food. We drove over to her apartment, where we found Ash hiding under the bed, as usual. Coaxed out and expertly caught, Ash was put in a carrier and we took him to his new home. I vivdly remember Ash's frightened expression as I tried to comfort him on the short ride to his new home.</p>
                    <p>Cats struggle to cope with major changes to their environment. Ash was no exception. He spent his first day under my bed, and only gradually over a few weeks did he come out and explore. He never liked the cat tree I bought for him, or really any of the toys. He just seemed to want to sit under my bed or on the windowsill and be left alone. I eventually discovered Ash sneaking onto the foot of my bed when I was asleep, so I bought a bed of his own for the same spot. Never have any of my gifts been such a hit with that cat as the original bed!</p>
                    <p>Ash eventually settled in. Still a shy cat, he hid whenever we had visitors but eventually came around to enjoy the company and scritches of my fiance and I. He never liked playing much and hates being picked up for hugs but is always happy to sit next to me as I work or play. He's great company and wants to take part of whatever I happen to be doing at the time. Ash is a very talkative cat, and lets you know when he wants some attention, or wants you to wake up and give him his favorite wet food.</p>
                    <p>I tried to train Ash once. I wanted to do something simple, so I tried to train him to place his paw in my hand, when I said 'paw" He didn't really connect the word to the action, but he sure did make the connection to the treats - soon he had me trained to give him treats whenever he put his paw on the side of my bed instead! </p>
                    <p>I took endless photos of Ash and post the best online. One of my discord friends also loved his grumpy expression so much he adpoted Ash as his 'spirit animal' and avatar! Just a few are posted below :)</p>
                    <p>Ash has been a fantastic friend over the past couple years, one that I love dearly. But Ash was lonely, and often cried in the night. He had never been alone until I adopted him. While Ash continued his daily routine, plans were made to add to the family...</p>

                    <h2>Han</h2>
                    <p>I had long planned to get a second cat, and over the course of the preceeding month, decided it was time to do so. After much reading and research and advice, we decided that a male kitten would be the least threatening to Ash and the most likely to be accepted, although I was happy to adopt an adult cat if one spoke to me. Cats are infamously territorial, after all, and Ash had an entire year to make the apartment his own.</p>
                    <p>November 3, 2018. My fiance and I went down to the Humane Society shelter near our house. We took our time and looked through all the cat enclosures. So many good cats that needed homes, but we could adopt only one. I walked slowly through the kitten enclsosure, trying to make eye contact with every kitten. I passed one 4 month old gray furball named "Hannibal", sleeping soundly in his blanket, and continued my rounds. Having looked through all the enclosures once and not finding the right cat I decided I'd take one more trip through before we came back another day. That's when I heard a high pitched little meow. I turned around and Hannibal had woken up, and was pawing at the glass in my direction. We played through the glass for several minutes, before I decided this was the kitten I wanted to spend some time playing with.</p>
                    <p>The humane society, when you find a cat you like, will have one of their staff fetch the cat and bring it to a small room where you can interact and ask questions. That's what we did. The instant Hannibal was in the room, his personality shone through as the little ball of energy played with the toys and chased our hands around and decided to climb up my jacket for a hug. Such an endearing fluff! It was clear very quickly I had found the right cat - or rather, he had found me. We brought Hannibal home that afternoon. We made one major change however - I didn't like the name Hannibal, but my fiance wanted to keep something similiar. Then my Dad suggested Han, and the rest, as they say, is history. (Han Solo is one of my favorite characters!)</p>
                    <p>Now came the tough part. Introducing a kitten to a house with an established cat is quite the process. You ideally want to keep both cats isolated for a week or two, only able ot hear and smell each other through a gap under the door. This lets them get used to the idea of sharing the house and introduces them to each other. Ideally, you want them both to be on either sides of a door when you feed them so they associate the other cat with good things like food. Ideally. They say that battle plans never survive contact with the enemy, and this was never more true than trying to keep our cats seperated. I live in an apartment with two rooms... isolating them for two weeks meant keeping the cats from escaping one-room-confines for that time, while also living in the apartment and basically being a prisoner in your own house. There will be times when cats get into the other's space</p>
                    <p>Ash was Not. Happy. Initially he was frightened by the little meows coming from the living room and all the commotion. Then he grew angry as he smelled the kitten and decided he was an intruder. After he calmed down a bit we made the mistake of trying to introduce them to each other visually - we figured holding Ash and keeping Han enclosed in his playpen would allow them to just realize they were there and maybe let this thing go faster. Ash instead jumped from my hands, ran to the kitten, hissed and attacked the playpen wall, then ran for cover under the sofa. Han, initially happy to see a friend, decided he had to defend himself and hissed right back and kept hissing until we covered the playpen with a blanket and managed to rescue Ash.</p>
                    <p>Han was ultimately unphased. While Ash was a very quiet shy cat, Han was the exact opposite, spending every moment playing or exploring or climbing on anyone who would let him near or simply zooming at maximum speed in figure 8s around the living room. The happy little kitten got much bolder over the next few weeks and would dash into the bedroom whenever I opened the door, scaring Ash in his own sanctuary. But it was just that - fear, not anger - from Ash. Over time the two cats learned to tolerate each other in the same space, with Ash just defensively swiping at Han if he got too close but otherwise simply eyeing the kitten warily. Ash no longer meowed for company and gradually allowed Han close, which was good, but he also seemed much more grumpy and guarded. </p>
                    <p>Han grew very quickly, it only took a couple months to supass Ash. Then began the competition over space - first the kitchen, then the sofa, then the bed where I tend to lay and read when not busy (fighting over access to Mom). One cat would take control only to be challenged by the other cat in an endless cycle of king of the hill. Han often tried to assert dominance over Ash as cats do, and while Ash wouldn't submit he didn't fight back either... a depressed Ash just wanted to be left alone with Mom.</p>
                    <p>All this changed one day in May 2019, when my apartment complex decided that we needed new windows to be installed. They gave me almost no time to prepare, and as such, both cats were at home when the workers arrived. Part of replacing the windows included sawing through the metal frame that once sealed the old windows - making an almighty racket in the process. During the 3 or 4 hours they were working the cats hid under the bed and waited. Both cats were clearly traumatized by the experience, to the point even normally friendly Han would hide any time there was a knock on the door going forward. </p>
                    <p>Despite its unpleasantness, the shared trauma seems to have helped both cats work out their differences. Both cats are now willing to spend time on the same bed or couch cushion, or to eat without pushing for space, and while han still teases Ash, Ash has begun to not only tolerate it but to play right back. As a plus, the old Ash, the happy Ash, has returned as worries over Han seem to have dissipated. It was a long road but at long last my two cats are becoming friends! </p>
                    <p>Its been just 18 months since I adopted Ash, and just 7 since I adopted Han. So much has changed and so many adventures have taken place. I look forward to seeing what my two favorite cats do going forward, and hope we have many more wonderful years together.</p>
